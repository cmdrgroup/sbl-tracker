# ARCHITECTURE — Command Overlay (sbl-tracker)

## Purpose
Multi-tenant operational picture for the fractional Chief-of-Staff engagement. One row per
client; tracks the **deliverables pipeline** (playbooks/SOPs), **coaching cadence** (Captain's
Table logs + decisions + action items), **AI briefs**, and a per-client **activity feed**.

- **Product name:** Command Overlay (formerly "SBL Tracker" / "SBL Playbook").
- **Hosting:** **Vercel** static SPA. App at **`app.commandoverlay.com`** (Vercel project
  `sbl-tracker`, git-connected → push `main` auto-deploys). `commandoverlay.com`/`www` is a
  *separate* marketing-landing Vercel project. Repo `cmdrgroup/sbl-tracker`. Lovable retired as host.

## Tech
| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | TanStack Start v1.167 (Vite 7, React 19, TS) — used purely client-side, no SSR data |
| Routing | TanStack Router, file-based (`src/routes/`) |
| Server state | TanStack Query (`src/lib/hooks.ts`) |
| UI | Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui (Radix) in `src/components/ui/`; framer-motion; recharts |
| Backend | Supabase (`bsvreslnbuqkjgnufpis` "Command Overlay CRM"), ap-northeast-1 |
| Build wrapper | `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` (injects tanstack/react/tailwind/tsconfig-paths/cloudflare/componentTagger) |

## Routes (`src/routes/`)
- `__root.tsx` — HTML shell (`shellComponent`), head/meta, 404.
- `_app.tsx` — authed layout: loads clients, provides `ClientContext`, renders `AppShell`.
- `_app.index.tsx` — Overview/dashboard. `_app.playbooks` · `_app.sops` · `_app.submit`
  (quick SOP submit — Loom and/or Scribe) · `_app.register` (**SOP Register** — printable/
  exportable index of approved SOPs + links) · `_app.coaching` (**read-only Decisions &
  Commitments**; coaching SoR = TOC) · `_app.insights` (AI briefs) · `_app.team` · `_app.settings`.

## Data model (Supabase `public`)
`clients` (tenants) → has many `workstreams`, `playbooks` (type ∈ sop/framework/script/policy/
campaign/playbook/other; status pipeline not_started→submitted→under_review→refined→approved;
recordings via `loom_url` and/or `scribe_url`; `submitted_by`/`submitted_at` stamp the
authenticated INDIVIDUAL who shipped each submission — `owner_name` stays the free-text
department owner; powers the "Your submissions" trail on `/submit`), `coaching_logs` (+ `coaching_decisions`,
`brett_sitrep`/`curtis_sitrep` — **read-only in Overlay; capture removed, coaching owned by TOC**),
`action_items` (open/done/overdue), `activity_feed`, `ai_briefs`, `client_integrations`
(loom/slack/google_drive/xero/notion/clickup — scaffolded). `users` ↔ `clients` via
`client_users` (roles commander/owner/member; `users.role` team_member gets a slimmed nav —
no Team/Settings/AI-Insights — while data stays RLS-scoped as before). Full column detail + FKs in
[docs/SUPABASE-NOTES.md](docs/SUPABASE-NOTES.md).

## Key client modules (`src/lib/`)
- `supabase.ts` — singleton client; URL + anon key hardcoded.
- `hooks.ts` — all TanStack Query hooks; each branches on `isDevBypassHost()` for mock data.
  Coaching *write* hooks removed (read-only `useCoachingLogs` remains).
- `dev-bypass.ts` — mock user/profile/clients for localhost + lovable preview hosts.
- `auth-context.ts` / `auth-provider.tsx` — Supabase Auth session; real auth only on the
  published production host.
- `client-context.ts` — active-client switcher state (`useActiveClient`, `useRequiredClient`).
- `types.ts` — DB row types (source of truth for shapes). `staff.ts`, `demo-data.ts`,
  `demo-seed.ts` — roster + demo seeding helpers.

## Rendering / deployment shape
- No server functions, loaders, or `beforeLoad` → **fully client-rendered**.
- Production build (`cloudflare:false`, `spa.enabled:true`) emits a static SPA:
  `dist/client/_shell.html` + hashed `dist/client/assets/*`. Serve `_shell.html` for all
  non-asset routes (SPA fallback). `dist/server/` is produced but unused for static hosting.
- Lovable dependency: the `@lovable.dev/*` build packages and the `componentTagger`/HMR-gate
  dev plugins. They install from npm and don't block independence, but full de-coupling means
  inlining the Vite config (see docs/DEPLOY-VERCEL.md "Full independence").

## Place in the CMDR system
Command Overlay is the **client-facing delivery tracker** sitting alongside, not inside, the
production **TOC** app (`commandtoc.com`, `cmdrgroup/toc-app`, Supabase `CMDR-TOC`). Ownership
split: **Overlay = SOP/playbook delivery**; **TOC = coaching system-of-record** (sessions,
sitreps, decisions, dossiers). Data is **not unified** across CMDR Supabase projects
(bridge-not-merge). Decided: every Overlay `client` also exists as a TOC `member`. The TOC↔Overlay
bridge (curated coaching feed in, delivery status out) is future work — see
[docs/TOC-INTEGRATION.md](docs/TOC-INTEGRATION.md).
